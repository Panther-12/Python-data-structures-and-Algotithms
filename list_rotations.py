# Rotated list: This is where the last element of a list is inserted before the firs element
#               for each rotation Eg. [2,5,8,9] rotated once results to: [9,2,5,8]
# Sorted list: Items in ascending order

# Write a function that takes a sorted rotated list and finds the number of times it was rotated
# The output enums is the number of rotations


# Edge cases: Empty,one element,rotated n times
